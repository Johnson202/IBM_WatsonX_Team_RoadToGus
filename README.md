IBM Granite-3.1-8B-Instruct model was chosen for optimal outputs in the personal finance domain (based on available foundational models, in terms of cost vs. risk).
Mistral Medium 3 model scored the highest on the basis of the FinQA metric, at 40 (relative to all other foundational models available in Prompt Lab in WatsonX). IBM Granite-3.1-8B-Instruct model scored only a 5 in terms of the FinQA metric, but due to its low cost and still decent performance in a client-facing setting or when used in regulated settings, Granite is the safer, more reliable pick.
